            <h1>About Me</h1>
            
            <p>Ever since I was younger I’ve always wanted to make something of my own. Whether it was a movie, book, video game; it didn’t matter. My thought process was always that I would grow up to be a creator. When I started writing music I was instantly hooked. I knew for sure that it was what I wanted to do. 
 
     
                Since coming to Loyola I have performed 5 times in New Orleans. Twice at Tipitina’s and once at school,once at the Labyrinth, and once at a house party. Back home I also have  upon myself to continue to perform at parties back home.  I am also finishing up work on a conceptual EP “Duality” which includes 3 singles that I have dropped this year “OUTTHENEST!!!”,“Southwest”, and “SomeoneToldMe”. I want my music to inspire people to follow their passion and never give up. As I know how frustrating it can be to want to make a career out of being a performing artist, but I am determined to stick through until the end.</p>
